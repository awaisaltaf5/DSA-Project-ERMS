# 🚨 Emergency Response Management System (ERMS)

The **Emergency Response Management System (ERMS)** is a console-based C++ application designed to efficiently handle, prioritize, and resolve emergency incidents. It supports role-based access for Admins and Staff, dynamically prioritizes emergencies using a priority queue, and maintains a history of resolved cases using a stack. A time-based escalation feature ensures unattended emergencies are re-prioritized for prompt action.
